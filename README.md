# Thyroid Disorder Detection using Machine Learning

## Abstract
Detection of thyroid disorders is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment. This project employs classification-based machine learning techniques to predict the presence of thyroid disorders using patient data. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify patients as either normal or having thyroid disorders.

## Introduction
Thyroid disease diagnosis involves various procedures, including medical examinations and blood tests. Machine learning plays a vital role in medical diagnosis by providing accurate predictions based on patient data. Early detection of thyroid disorders is essential to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.

## About Thyroid
The thyroid gland regulates metabolism and various bodily functions. Disorders affecting thyroid hormone secretion can have significant health consequences, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

## Literature Survey
Several studies have explored different approaches to thyroid disease prediction using machine learning techniques. These studies have employed various classification algorithms and data preprocessing methods to improve accuracy and performance.

## Existing System
The existing system relies on traditional methods of thyroid disease diagnosis, which may lack accuracy and efficiency. This project aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging machine learning algorithms for early detection and accurate prediction of thyroid disorders.

## Proposed System
The proposed system utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to predict thyroid disorders based on patient data. The system preprocesses the dataset, trains the models, and evaluates their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## System Architecture
The system architecture consists of modules for uploading the dataset, preprocessing, training machine learning models, and predicting disease from test data. Each module performs specific tasks to facilitate the detection of thyroid disorders.

## Hardware & Software Requirements
The system requires a standard computer system with sufficient memory and processing power. It is compatible with Windows operating systems and implemented using the Python programming language.

## Modules
1. **Upload Thyroid Dataset**: Allows users to upload the dataset for analysis.
